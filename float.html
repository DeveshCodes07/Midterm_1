      <h1>
        Thomas Shelby, often called Tommy, is the central character of the
        series Peaky Blinders. As the ambitious and sharp-minded leader of the
        Shelby family, he rises from a World War I veteran to one of the most
        powerful gang leaders in Birmingham. Known for his calm personality,
        strategic thinking, and fearless attitude, Thomas transforms the Peaky
        Blinders from a small street gang into a strong political and business
        force. Despite his power, Tommy constantly struggles internally with
        trauma from the war, complicated family responsibilities, and the heavy
        burden of leadership. His character is admired for his intelligence,
        determination, and ability to outsmart even the most dangerous enemies.
        Thomas Shelby stands as a symbol of ambition, resilience, and the dark
        charm that defines Peaky Blinders.
